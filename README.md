# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

## Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not

predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not

## what does this notebook contains!
### 1. Download data from Kaggel.
### 2. Visualizing the text dataset.
### 3. Converting text into numbers.
  * Create Text vectorization
  * Create an Embedding
### 4. running a series of experiments.
  running a series of experiments
  * Model 1: Feed-forward neural network (dense model)
  * Model 2: LSTM model (RNN)
  * Model 3: 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  * Model 4: TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Feature Extractor (using trandfer learning for NLP)
### 5. Comparing the performance of each of our models.
### 6. Use the best trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
### 7. Combine the ensemble predictions using the majority vote (mode).
### 8. Make a confusion matrix with the best performing model
